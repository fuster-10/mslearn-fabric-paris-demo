# Part 1: Analyze data in a data warehouse
### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes
In Microsoft Fabric, a data warehouse provides a relational database for large-scale analytics. Unlike the default read-only SQL endpoint for tables defined in a lakehouse, a data warehouse provides full SQL semantics; including the ability to insert, update, and delete data in the tables.

### Lab objectives
You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a data warehouse
- Task 2: Create tables and insert data
- Task 3: Define a data model
- Task 4: Query data warehouse tables
- Task 5: Create a view
- Task 6: Create a visual query
- Task 7: Visualize your data

  
## Task 1: Create a data warehouse
In this task, you will design and implement a data warehouse by organizing data from multiple sources, creating ETL processes, and optimizing for performance. The goal is to enable efficient querying and reporting while ensuring security, compliance, and scalability.
